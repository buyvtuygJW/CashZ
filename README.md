Developer info>

This app use source code from other foss project like:

https://github.com/buyvtuygJW/Jetpackutil

Thus it is not directly zip buildable from android studio.

Build flow:

1)Download git zip

2)extract and go to source read the readme and find those source and paste into that directory.

3)setup android studio and open the project root folder download dependencies then build.
